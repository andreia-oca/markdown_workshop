Markdown is a lightweight markup language that’s easy to read and write, perfect for creating formatted text with minimal effort. You'll typically find markdown files in blogs, documentation, and README files.

Markdown syntax is simple:
- **Headers** are created with `#`, `##`, `###` (similar to HTML `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`)
- **Emphasis**: Use `*` or `_` for *italics*, and `**` or `__` for **bold**
- **Lists** are created with `-` for unordered, and numbers for ordered lists
- **Links**: `[Link text](URL)`

Here’s a sample code block in markdown:

```markdown
# Hello Markdown
**This is bold text!**
*This is italicized*
```
